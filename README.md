---->1st of all i create two user input awhere we can enter the name of city
--->then the distance from two city will show in the map;
---> then regarding that distance i apply the logic of fair price;
-->the logic is. ( Rs5/km for the first 10km, Rs2/km for the next 20, and Rs1/km after that);
...>then i display the price;

..here i used ..google javascript api & google distance matrix api,
.. i was trying to calculate the on road distance but for that i have to pay google to access their data,that's why i used the custom input lattitude and longitude;
